[[Epic Games]], the maker of the popular video game [[Fortnite]], has filed a lawsuit against [[Apple]] for allegedly violating antitrust laws and engaging in anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit stems from a dispute over the 30% commission that [[Apple]] charges developers for in-app purchases made through its [[App Store]]. [[Epic Games]] claims that this fee is unfair and harms both developers and consumers. It also accuses [[Apple]] of abusing its dominant position in the mobile app market and preventing other payment options from being available. [[Epic Games]] is seeking injunctive relief and damages from [[Apple]], as well as the right to distribute its own app store on iOS devices. [[Apple]], on the other hand, argues that its [[App Store]] policies are necessary to ensure quality, security, and privacy for its users. It also says that [[Epic Games]] breached its contract by introducing its own payment system without its approval.'''
